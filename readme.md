The data is prepared according to the Readme in the TGDataset folder. Following that, preprocessing is performed using 'pipeline.py', which can be schedules using 'repeatrun.sh' (to automatically restart after crashing).
After preprocessing the data, clustering and analysis is performed in 'topic_modeling_BERT.ipynb'.
